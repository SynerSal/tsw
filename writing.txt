I'm just writing here because i wanna improve my typing speed by going slower but at the same time improving my accuracy would be very beneficial. So here's what I'll say. 

I really recommend speed typing or whatever is called haha. I actually used  tool to learn which was called type with ms. someone idk haha. 

I spent a whole day doing that. That and monkeytype to practice more. It really made me a whole lot better at it. 

I'm not super proficient yet because i don't exactly practice daily but hey, i made huge progresses and at least i'm not looking at my keyboard while i type hehe. That's what this really is all about, not looking at the keyboard and letting your fingers do the magic for you. 

It all comes down to practice and learning and habit after all, i'm telling you.

Now that's it for today, i'm gonna push this to git hub and then delete it lmaoo.

I made that at least 10+ times but it never gets old. Plus it's all practice and that's good for my memory.

Aigth bye.
